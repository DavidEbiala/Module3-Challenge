# Module3-Challenge

This is a ReadMe for a password generator. It generates a password based on the input recieved by the User.
If the User decides to have number, uppercase letters, and special characters in the password, it would be
displayed in the password generator box.

This project automatically gives lowercase letters, regardless of if it's chosen by the user or not.
It ranges from 8-128 characters. If the user's length doesn't meet this requirement, an error message would be shown 
to the user until they fulfill this requirement.
